## Introduction
This project involves the development of an interactive side-scrolling game. The game challenges players to control a character, avoid obstacles, and achieve certain objectives.

## Game Overview
The game features colorful graphics and engaging visuals that enhance the player experience. It incorporates dynamically generated obstacles and rewards to provide a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience.

## Gameplay Mechanics
Players control a character using keyboard controls. The character can move horizontally and execute jumps. The goal is to navigate through the obstacles while collecting rewards to score points.

## Objectives and Scoring
Players aim to collect positive obstacles to gain points (crowns) while avoiding negative obstacles that deduct points (lives). The game tracks the player's score and displays it in real-time on the screen. To win, players must achieve a specific score threshold.

## Graphics and UI
The game features vibrant graphics and a user interface that displays the player's score and remaining lives. Visual elements such as crowns (for points) and gems (for lives) are used to represent in-game progress.

Here are some screenshots from different screens of the game to give you a visual overview of the gameplay.

## Player Interaction
Players interact with the game through keyboard controls (arrows). The player character responds to movement inputs and can perform jumps to navigate obstacles.

## Challenges and Strategies
The dynamically generated obstacles pose challenges for players. Strategies include timing jumps, prioritizing positive obstacles, and using quick reflexes to avoid negative obstacles.

## Technical Implementation
The game is developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Object-oriented programming principles are employed to manage player, obstacle, and game mechanics.

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements may include adding more levels and different players to choose, also introducing new types of obstacles, incorporating sound effects, and refining the overall gameplay experience.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser.
3. Use keyboard controls to navigate the character and interact with the game.
